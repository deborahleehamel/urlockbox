# URLockbox

URLockbox is a project used for Module 4 assessment at Turing School.

We will build out a rails application that allows an authenticated user to:
  * submit and view links
  * update link status with options to "Mark as Read" and "Mark as Unread" without reloading the page
  * edit links after they have added some to my URLockbox when viewing links index
  * mark a link as read or unread without reloading page
  * filter list of link by search term as I type
  * click buttons/links to filter list by status("read" and "unread")
  * sort the list alphabetically
